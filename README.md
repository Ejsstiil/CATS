# CATS (Carrier Administration and Traversal System)
CATS is an interface for viewing information about your fleet carrier, and guiding it across many thousands of light years automatically.
<br>
Owning multiple carriers in this game requires the use of alt accounts, so this app allows you to view stats about carriers across multiple accounts.

## Features
### Admin interface
* View name, callsign, credits, fuel, current system and other stats for multiple carriers.
* Manage as many of your own carriers as you want.
* View cargo and market data for your carriers.
* Get carrier data from Frontier's API.
### Traversal system
* Automatic jump plotting
* Tritium restocking
* Route time estimations
* Keeps track of jump time (in case a jump is longer than 15 minutes)
* Discord integration
* Import routes from the Spansh fleet carrier router

## Limitations
* This only works on Windows and probably won't be ported to anything else.
* It also only works with PC accounts, though it does work with both Horizons and Odyssey.

## Privacy
All data for this app is stored locally; no information is sent to a server or to the developer.
